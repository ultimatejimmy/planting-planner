<p>Using data from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv9ITE5nuShQ37Xd-NVkdcg"><em>One Yard Revolution</em></a> on YouTube, this app tells you when to start seeds/plant outside based on your average last frost date. </p>
<p>If you know your last frost date, you can enter it.  Otherwise the app uses the Geolocation API along with the <a href="http://www.farmsense.net/">Farmsense API</a> and the <a href="https://ovsoinc.github.io/yacdn.org/">yacdn.org</a> CORS proxy to get your local last frost date.  This is based on 30% probability of hitting 36 degrees F (the highest frost temp).</p>
